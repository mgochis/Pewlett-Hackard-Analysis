# Pewlett-Hackard-Analysis

## Overview

Pewlett Hackard is facing a "silver tsunami" with several of their employees reaching retirement age. We have determined how many Hackard employees will be eligible for retirement, how many positions will be needing replaced and the potential of moving younger employees in a more senior roll with the mentorship program. This information was sourced by running several SQL queries on the current employee database. 

## Results

### Retirement Eligibility

The "silver tsunami" mentioned prior lives up to its name with 72,458 employees being eligible for retirement. Most of the employees eligible for retirement are Senior Engineers totaling 25,916 or 35.8% of the totaling retiring pool. Senior Staff attributes to 34% of the pool with 24,926 employees eligible for retirement. This is an alarming number of senior staff members that are eligible for retirement. Pewlett Hackard needs to ensure that these positions will be filled by other employees with an equal or greater skill set. The mentorship program could help facilitate the replacement of these retirering employees.

### Mentorship Eligiblity

One way to combat the massive number of employees eligible for retirement is to ensure that there are well trained younger staff that can slide into those rolls as the retiring staff departs. Pewlett-Hackard's mentorship eligibility report does not deliver great news. Only 1,549 employees are eligible to participate in the mentorship program, which comes in well short of the total number of employees that are eligible to retire. Pewlett-Hackard is going to find alternative ways to accumulate employees to replace the ones that are going to potentially retire.
